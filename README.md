# DIST-training-free-dermoscopic-image-skin-tone-style-transfer-with-lesion-preservation
This repository provides the official implementation of **DIST**, a training-free diffusion-based framework designed for **skin-tone style transfer in dermoscopic imaging**.  
DIST achieves **realistic tone adaptation** while **strictly preserving diagnostic lesion structure**.

🚧 **This work is currently under submission.  
The full codebase and pretrained configurations will be released upon paper acceptance.**

Stay tuned for updates!
